# Pentagon numbers 

## [Problem Description](https://projecteuler.net/problem=44)

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P<sub>4</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> = 22 + 70 = 92 = P<sub>8</sub>. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P<sub>j</sub> and P<sub>k</sub>, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P<sub>k</sub> − P<sub>j</sub>| is minimised; what is the value of D?
